### How to leak confidential documents

If you have information about issues which should be investigated, share them with one of afriLeaks's news partners using this site. Consider that concrete information and evidence, such as source documents, gives a journalist more to work with and increases the likelihood that your issue gets taken up.

### Protect your identity

Leaking sensitive information involves risks. There are both social and technical risks that threaten your anonymity. At the same time, there are measures you can take to protect yourself. See 'Your Security' for more details.

### Who should receive your information?

The press checks those in power and exposes misconduct or abuse of power. The media has the resources to bring issues into the public light. Journalists are professionals who investigate, ask critical questions, and ensure all parties involved are asked about their side of the story. Furthermore, they work for mass media (newspapers, magazines, websites, radio, or television programs) through which they can make their research public.
