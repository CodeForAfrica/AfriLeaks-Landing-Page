### How to leak confidential documents

If you have information of issues which should be investigated, share them with one of afriLeaks's news partners on this site. Consider that concrete information and evidence, such as source documents, gives a journalist more to work with and increases the chance that your issue gets taken up.

### Protect your identity

When you leak sensitive information, it involves risks. There are both social and technical risks that threaten your anonymity. But there are measures you take to protect yourself. See 'Your Security' for more details.

### Who should receive your information?

The press checks those in power, and exposes misconducts or abuse of power. The media has the resources to do so. Journalists are professionals who investigate, ask critical questions, and ensure all parties involved are asked about their side of the story. Furthermore, they work for mass media (newspapers, magazines, websites, radio, or television programs), through which they can make their knowledge public.
