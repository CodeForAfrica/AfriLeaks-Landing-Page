### About afriLeaks

AfriLeaks is run by an alliance of African news organisations that are committed to speaking truth to power. Our secure web platform helps you to send us source documents, whether they are memos, contracts, accounts or other evidence of corruption and misbehaviour.

You will be able to send us documents and select which of our member organisations should investigate it. This site also helps you to stay in touch and answer further questions without revealing your name or contact information.

AfriLeaks is an online system which enables users to anonymously send material to investigative media organisations of their choice. Documents with relevant information can be uploaded through the site. These pieces will be send to participating media organisations through highly secure systems that render tracing difficult to impossible. Sources, whistleblowers and other users can, after selecting investigative media, continue to receive messages from the media house that are sent by untraceable codes. This is absolutely anonymous and recommended for investigative processes. Journalists can use the system to interview and investigate the veracity of content/sources and decide thereafter whether to use the information as leads for eventual publication. 



The system, therefore allows for relevant confidential or sensitive information to reach the public, while protecting the sender. The afriLeaks team has no access whatsoever to the content of the documents nor the identity of the sender o any other data; and does not play any role, nor are we privy, to the interactions between the journalists and the sender/sources.

We provide only the infrastructure. The African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR), hosting afriLeaks, is comprised of media houses across the continent. This initiative is made possible by the support of the Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights (HERMES), Free Press Unlimited (FPU) and Hivos.
