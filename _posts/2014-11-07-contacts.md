AfriLeaks has a small budget, which consists of contributions by the participation organisations and funds.

Since AfriLeaks is a public initiative, it is very important to us to know that we are also supported by citizens who share our conviction that openness and transparency are a fundamental part of a healthy public debate.

Thank you for your consideration.
