### Support us with your donation
AfriLeaks has a small budget, which consists of contributions by the participation organisations and funds.

Since it is a public initiative, it is very important to us to know that we are also supported by citizens who share our conviction that openness and transparency are a fundamental part of a healthy public debate.

Your support to AfriLeaks helps us finacially but also provides moral support.

You can support us by transferring your donation to our bank account: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Thank you for your consideration.
