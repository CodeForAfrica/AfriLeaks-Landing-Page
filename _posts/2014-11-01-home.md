# AfriLeaks
{: .text-black}


AfriLeaks provides a highly secure environment for sources and whistleblowers to confidentially, or anonymously, submit information to individual investigative media houses across Africa as well as global media. Though 'leaking'is not without risks, AfriLeaks technology is designed to ensure that the sender, location and other data cannot be traced to protect the identity of the sender. Please read and adhere to the guidelines in order to make the best use of the platform.

Do you have any sensitive information that you want to share with us?
