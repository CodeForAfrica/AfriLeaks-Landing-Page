# How To Use AfriLeaks

## Leaking Documents

In every society, wrongdoings and abuse of power occur. You might have information on or knowledge of issues which are not correct and which you think should be investigated. Of course, more concrete information and evidence gives a journalist more to work with and increases the chance that the issue gets taken up.

## Upload Anonymously

When you leak sensitive information, it involves risks. There are both social and technical risks that threaten your anonymity. But there are measures you take to protect yourself.

## Select Receivers

The press checks those in power, and exposes misconducts or abuse of power. The media has the resources to do so. Journalists are professionals who investigate, ask critical questions, and ensure all parties involved are asked about their side of the story. Furthermore, they work for mass media (newspapers, magazines, websites, radio, or television programs), through which they can make their knowledge public.
