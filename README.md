afriLEAKS
=========

afriLEAKS is an encrypted platform that helps whistleblowers anonymously communicate with journalists / civic watchdogs. The public website is accessible at: https://afrileaks.org/ 

afriLEAKS is a project of the African Network of Centres of Investigative Reporting (ANCIR), with technical support from Code for Africa (CfAfrica).

The afriLEAKS software platform is a fork of Publeaks.

The afriLEAKS service is used by ANCIR member newsrooms across Africa, to help give whistleblowers and other confidential sources better security when they wish to communicate with journalists. afriLEAKS member newsrooms run specially configured air-gap leakTOP computers as dedicated terminals for receiving afriLEAKS transmissions.

ANCIR also provides additional forensic research and investigative support for afriLEAKS newsrooms, to ensure that all leads transmitted through the platform receive the best possible attention from journalists.
