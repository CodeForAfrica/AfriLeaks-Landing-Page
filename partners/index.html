    <h4>Information about the temporary secondary receiver</h4>
    <div class="alert alert-warning">
      
      <p>
        Part of the fundamental design of afriLeaks is that submitted materials can only be accessed by those to whom they were addressed. This is enforced using strong encryption, which is a bit harder to use than normal email.
      </p>

      <p>
        Until all of you have gained some experience with these tools, we have proposed the temporary model of a secondary receiver. It means that ANCIR technical advisor Friedrich Lindenberg will receive a copy of all submitted content.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will not engage in any journalistic analysis of the material without your explicit say-so - that job is still yours, although ANCIR is happy to support your investigations through it's <a href="http://investigativecenters.org/ilab">iLab</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The secondary receiver means that if you're having trouble with the platform, a copy of the material will exist that you can work with.
